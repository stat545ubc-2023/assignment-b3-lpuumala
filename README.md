## Overview
This repository contains files for building a Shiny app that visualizes data collected in James Hoffmann's Great American Coffee Taste Test. In this taste test, approximately 4000 participants completed a questionnaire about their coffee preferences and habits. Participants also completed a blind taste test of four different coffees, extracted and provided by Comateer. Coffees A-C were washed coffees with different roast levels: A was a light roast, B was a medium roast, and C was a dark roast. Coffee D was a light roast, natural processed coffee.  

The original dataset can be found in the description box of James Hoffmann's video, ["Surprising and Fascinating Results from the Taste Test"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0).
